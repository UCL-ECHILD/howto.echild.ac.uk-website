# Guide 12: children's social care {.unnumbered}

*This page is under construction. Please check back soon.*

ECHILD contains the two children's social care datasets: the child in need (CiN) census and the children looked after (CLA) return. The CiN contains data on children referred to social care, including children in need and those on child protection plans. The CLA return contains data on all children looked after.

While we build this page, to find out more about children's social care data you can consult the data resource profiles:
