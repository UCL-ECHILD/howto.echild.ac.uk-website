The website and series of guides was launched in February 2024 and was created by [Matthew Jay](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/60536-matthew-jay){target="_blank"}. Matt has been working with messy administrative data for well over a decade and hopes that these guides will help researchers, especially those new to ECHILD's constituent datasets, avoid the many frustrations and that have kept him tied to his desk well into the night.

This website is supported by ADR UK (Administrative Data Research UK), an Economic and Social Research Council (part of UK Research and Innovation) programme (ES/V000977/1, ES/X000427/1 and ES/X003663/1).

You can find out more about ECHILD on the [ECHILD website](https://www.echild.ac.uk/){target="_blank"} and on [UCL's website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/research/population-policy-and-practice-research-and-teaching-department/cenb-clinical-20){target="_blank"}.
